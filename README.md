# Snake

You control the snake and it's mirrored version. Food in different colors appears on the map. If you eat food matching your snake color you get +1 length. If you eat the wrong color food you get -1 length and one snake fragment falls off, creating poisoned food. Eating poisoned food causes -3 length. If the length of the snake drops below zero or there is a collision with wall / tail / mirrored snake you lose. The game lacks a bit of graphic coherence, but I like it anyway.
